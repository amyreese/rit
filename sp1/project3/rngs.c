/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Adapted from a multiple-stream RNG developed by Steve Park and Dave
 * Geyer.  This version only has a single stream, and supplies only the
 * Random() and PutSeed() functions, with PutSeed() modified so that a
 * value > 0 is the seed, and for any other value the original default
 * seed value is used.
 *
 * Original documentation:
 *
 * This is an ANSI C library for multi-stream random number generation.  
 * The use of this library is recommended as a replacement for the ANSI C 
 * rand() and srand() functions, particularly in simulation applications 
 * where the statistical 'goodness' of the random number generator is 
 * important.  The library supplies 256 streams of random numbers; use 
 * SelectStream(s) to switch between streams indexed s = 0,1,...,255.
 *
 * The streams must be initialized.  The recommended way to do this is by
 * using the function PlantSeeds(x) with the value of x used to initialize 
 * the default stream and all other streams initialized automatically with
 * values dependent on the value of x.  The following convention is used 
 * to initialize the default stream:
 *    if x > 0 then x is the state
 *    if x < 0 then the state is obtained from the system clock
 *    if x = 0 then the state is to be supplied interactively.
 *
 * The generator used in this library is a so-called 'Lehmer random number
 * generator' which returns a pseudo-random number uniformly distributed
 * 0.0 and 1.0.  The period is (m - 1) where m = 2,147,483,647 and the
 * smallest and largest possible values are (1 / m) and 1 - (1 / m)
 * respectively.  For more details see:
