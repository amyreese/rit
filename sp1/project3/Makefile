# Note use of 'cpp' to convert .S files to temporary .s files: this allows
# use of #include/#define/#ifdef statements. However, the line numbers of
# error messages reflect the .s file rather than the original .S file. 
# (If the .s file already exists before a .S file is assembled, then
# the temporary .s file is not deleted.  This is useful for figuring
# out the line numbers of error messages, but take care not to accidentally
# start fixing things by editing the .s file.)
